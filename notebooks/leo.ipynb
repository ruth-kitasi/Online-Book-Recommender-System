    "## 1. Introduction  \n",
    "The **Online Book Recommender System** aims to personalize user experiences by suggesting relevant books based on their preferences and behavior. With the growing volume of books available online, users often face **choice overload**, leading to decreased engagement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Goals**:  \n",
    "- Improve user retention and engagement.  \n",
    "- Increase cross-selling/up-selling opportunities.  \n",
    "- Solve the \"cold-start\" problem for new users/books.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:  \n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage user-book interactions (e.g., ratings).  \n",
    "- **Content-Based Filtering**: Use book metadata (genre, author, descriptions).  \n",
    "- **Hybrid Model**: Combine both for more accurate recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Problem Statement  \n",
    "**Core Objective**:  \n",
    "> *\"Build a ML system that recommends books to users based on their past behavior and book features, while addressing data sparsity and cold-start challenges.\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**:  \n",
    "1. **Data Sparsity**: Most users rate very few books.  \n",
    "2. **Cold Start**: No historical data for new users/books.  \n",
    "3. **Diversity**: Avoiding over-specialization in recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Metrics**:  \n",
    "- **Model**: RMSE (rating prediction), Precision@K (top-K recs).  \n",
    "- **Business**: Increased CTR, reduced bounce rates.  \n",
